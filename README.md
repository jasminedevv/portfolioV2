# New Portfolio: V2 BETA
I'm creating a new portfolio since [jasminehumbert.com](jasminehumbert.com) is getting crufty and because I need more excuses to write React.

It is a work in progress though you can see my initial v0.2 release [here](https://lacunahag.github.io/portfolioV2/). Feedback is appreciated at this stage so feel free to leave issues and notes.
