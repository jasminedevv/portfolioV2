It demonstrates usage of data structures like markov chains and histograms. Developing it I learned a lot about writing more efficient code since I initially optimized it for generating text.",

Three days into the project I learned more about the language and environment, realized this made no sense, and deleted the vast majority of code Iâ€™d written. The final version was refactored down to a single 23 line file. Since this project is essentially malware (of the harmless prank variety), I learned a lot about linux security.",
