## Welcome to my Portfolio Site!
### I'm a security focused full-stack engineer and am currently looking for a great job in San Francisco.

## Summary of my skills

### Full Stack
When I say I'm a full-stack developer I do mean that I have a broad area of expertise creating web applications. I've written docker images, built sensible APIs, written crazy MongoDB queries, and I even know how to center things in CSS! This website is written in React which is my frontend framework of choice. My favorite backend frameworks are Flask and Node/Express.

I've also got a bit of experience programming Arduinos and robots. C was the first real programming language I learned as a teenager.

### Application Security
One of my top skills is spotting pernicious mistakes in code reviews. I also have a lot of expertise on the technical details of specific vulnerabilities in web applications. I'm studying for my Comptia Security+ certification so I can hopefully specialize even more into security roles.

### Technical Writing
For fun, [I write tech tutorials on Medium](https://medium.com/@jasmine.yhumbert). I like writing about complicated stuff at a 5th grade reading level. My articles do well on Google searches and several thousand people read them every month.

## What kind of job am I looking for?
My ideal role is at a small company doing something technically challenging or making the world a better place. Company size doesn't matter too much but I like small teams where I don't feel too much like a code monkey. I'd love opportunities to take on more leadership responsibilities and drive technical decisions.

I would appreciate referrals to big companies as well.

### Some specific perks I'm looking for
- Office in the Market Street area
- Ability to work from home one day/week
- Good benefits
- Collaborative environment

### Don't recruit me for
- Visual design: I get frustrated easily trying to make things look pretty. I like UX design though!
- Talking to lots of new people all the time: I get recruited for developer relations roles a lot but these are a very bad fit for me! I'm much too introverted.

### Will I be a good culture fit?
If you have a company D&D party or a band/choir/acapella group I will be a fantastic culture fit!

Company cultures that value openness, trust, and mentorship are ones where I thrive. I love to help less experienced engineers and learn from my seniors.
