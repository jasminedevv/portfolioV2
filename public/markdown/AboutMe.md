## Welcome to my Portfolio Site!
### I'm a security focused full-stack engineer and am currently looking for a great job in San Francisco.

### I made this website to make it as easy as possible for a potential employer to figure out what my skills are. Click 'Search My Experience' above to see what I know and how I learned it.

## My skills

### Full Stack
When I say I'm a full-stack developer I do mean that I have a broad area of expertise creating web applications. I've managed/written loads of docker containers, built sensible APIs, written crazy MongoDB queries, and I even know how to center things in CSS! This website is written in React which is my frontend framework of choice. My favorite backend frameworks are Flask and Node/Express.

I've also got a bit of experience programming Arduinos and robots. C was the first real programming language I learned as a teenager.

### Application Security
One of my top skills is spotting pernicious mistakes in code reviews. I also have a lot of expertise on the technical details of specific vulnerabilities in web applications. I'm studying for my Comptia Security+ certification so I can hopefully specialize even more into security roles.

### Technical Writing
For fun, [I write tech tutorials on Medium](https://medium.com/@jasmine.yhumbert). I like writing about complicated stuff at a 5th grade reading level. My articles do well on Google searches and several thousand people read them every month.

## What kind of job I'm looking for
My ideal role is at a small startup doing something technically challenging and/or making the world a better place. Technology has a lot of power and as long as I'm using it to make things better (or even just less bad) for everyone I'm happy. Ethics aren't something I'm be willing to compromise on so please no contracts with ICE or submitting to Chinese censorship.

Company size doesn't matter too much but I like small teams where I don't feel too much like a code monkey. I'd love opportunities to take on more leadership responsibilities and drive technical decisions.

Health insurance and a San Francisco developer salary are hard requirements. I'm also paying back an income share agreement so equity/stock options work well for my situation.

### Things I'm bad at
- Visual design: I get frustrated easily trying to make things look pretty. I like UX design though!
- Talking to lots of people all the time: I get recruited for developer relations roles a lot but these are a very bad fit for me! I get tired fast when I have to meet new people all the time.

## Who I am as a person
If you've really looked through my github you may have found some extra nerdy non-programming related projects. I love linguistics and especially made up languages. I've written entire tabletop RPG settings in my free time for fun. My two favorite things to do with my friends are sing (karaoke is great) and play Dungeons and Dragons.

I also know a few non-made up languages including French, Tahitian, and Spanish. I was raised as a bi-native speaker of French and English. My French has gotten a tiny bit rusty living in the US but with a few weeks of immersion I lose my accent completely and speak both languages natively.
